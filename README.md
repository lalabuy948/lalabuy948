Octopus in IT and startup worlds from the Russian ocean. https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpopov/

Originally from Saint-Petersburg, living in Slovenia. Business runner and ruiner. I’m software engineer with passion for scalable and high-loaded systems. 

Helping other companies to grow. 📈 #TechScaling In a meanwhile I have title of Technical Team Lead on big media project. 

In the past I used to work as research agent, fullstack engineer, project manager and business runner. I worked on quite a few IT projects with primary focus on business logic, architecture, system scaling, data flows and data storages. As every casual entrepreneur I have bunch of failed startups 🤷🏻‍♂️. 

I don’t have preferred technology, In my opinion you have to choose language or specific technology based on your problem.

Do it best or don’t do it at all. Don't forget to procrastinate well. I hate running treadmill that’s why I’m running businesses.
