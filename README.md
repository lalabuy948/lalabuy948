Samurai warrior in IT and Startup whirlpools from the Russian ocean. https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpopov/

Originally from Saint-Petersburg, living in Slovenia. Business runner and ruiner. I’m software engineer with passion for scalable, distributed and high-loaded systems. In love with greek sculps, antique architecture, renaissance paintings and my muse of course.

Currently helping other companies and individuals to find balance between business and engineering. Technical stacks, technical debts, processes optimization and establishing, migration strategies and more. Ping me for consultation or personal mentoring session.

In the past I used to work as research agent, full-stack engineer, technical team lead, project manager and business runner. I worked on quite a few IT projects with primary focus on business logic, architecture, system scaling, data flows and data storages. As every casual entrepreneur I have bunch of failed startups 🤷🏻‍♂️.

I don’t have preferred technology, In my opinion you have to choose language or specific technology based on your problem.

Do it best or don’t do it at all. Don't forget to procrastinate well.
